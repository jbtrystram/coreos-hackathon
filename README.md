# 2024 Halloween CoreOS Hackathon


# Introduction
We are excited to announce the hackathon for team coreos. Hackathons are for working on projects you might find interesting but otherwise could not due to priorities from work. In this hackathon we are going to be introducing a theme on the start date which your project needs to incorporate in some form. After its announced you should start thinking of an idea to add to the board of idea's for that particular theme. That board will then be used to form the teams based on interest. You will have 4 days to work on your project with your team members. After which your project will be presented in a video and voted on for 3 aspects: | **Creativity** | **Functional** | **Theme-Related** |.

## Week before hackathon
A week before the hackathon begins we will be announcing the topics for this year's hackathon. If you have an idea that is within this years theme we implore you to create an Issue on this repository with the label of the theme it targets. Then once the hackathon begins on the first day we will split into groups based on the ideas and what each person wants to pursue. 

- Submit any and all ideas as issues for tracking on this repo with the appropriate label
- Read other issues and see if you find any interest in other issues. 
- Note: just because you submit an issue, you are not responsible for it.
