# 2024 Back-to-school CoreOS Hackathon


# Introduction
We are excited to announce the hackathon for team coreos. Hackathons are for working on projects you might find intresting but otherwise could not due to priorities from work. In this hackathon we are going to be introducing a theme on the start date which your project needs to encorperate in some form. After its announced you should start thinking of an idea to add to the board of idea's for that particular theme. That board will then be used to form the teams based on intrest. You will have 4 days to work on your project with your team members. After which your project will be presented in a video and voted on for 3 aspects: | **Creativity** | **Functional** | **Theme-Related** |.

## When ? 
Week of October 21st through 25th.

## Rules
Normal sprint duties outside of customer issues will be put on pause during the 4 day hackathon so do not stress about meeting conflicts. 

- Project needs to be on theme
- Every member must try to contribute.
- Have fun!

## Expectations
- Group of 2 - 4 members work colaboratively for 4 days.
    - Setup a working meeting during timzone overlap to distribute work items for independent work. We recognise that you and your team will not be able to collab for long periods of time.
- Somthing needs to be demo-able by the end of the third day as day four is reserved for presentation and votes.
-  A demo-able item is not simply limited to code or a run-able project. It can be writen as in doc's | jira | upstream issue | data collection | etc.
